# A-pathfinding
visual implementation of A* using SFML (C++)

Developpment done with SFML 2.4.2

HOW TO USE:

1. Build and install SFML. I used cmake for that process
2. For codeblock, set linker settings for sfml-window, sfml-graphics, sfml-system, set search directories for linker/compiler
3. How to play:
   - first click sets starting point
   - second click sets end point
   - next clicks draw walls
   - press ENTER to start pathfinding
